
Day 1 -- 

	Python is a general purpose language
	It is also known as Scientist language

	It is very simple as it is a higher level programming language unlike Java,C,C++,C# which are lower level programming language

	As a developer we have very few things to control, almost everything would be taken care by language itself

			We have no control over Memory management,Garbage collectors, performance tuning

	Python is bit slow in performance, in comparision of C,C++,JAVA,C#

		It is a dynamically typed language
		entire language stack would be availabe at runtime

		For human it is impossible to understand diff between 0.01 and 0.001 ms

		If we go with high end infrastructure, we can host our workloads in Cloud, we can scale-up our existing infra


	  Pyhton code is much more concise and short
	 It requires less time and efforts to develop application using Python
	 We get Rapid Application Development with Python
	Python codes are 3 to 5 times shorter than JAVA and C#


	Python comes with various libraries

		NumPY : mathemetical calculation
		SciPY: Scientific calculation
		Padas : Data Science
		PyTorch : ML
		Tensorflow : AI
		Flask: Designing Web APIs
		DJango : Web Application using MVC design pattern
		Python is fully object-oriented programming language -- Supports all 4 pillars of OOP -- Abstraction, Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation




		translated to byte code by Python interpreter		ingested to PVM at runtime

			Python Interpreters -- 2 falvours -- CPython - default interpreter, written in C language
							     Jython - written in JAVA

			Python Modules -- Random,Date,Time,Decimal,File,CSV,PDF,RE,CPickle,FuncTools

    When we install Python, by default we get IDLE -- Intergrated Learning Environment
						Pycharm,IntelliJ,VS Code,Sublime,ATOM etc.....



	
			print(*args,sep=" ",end="\n")
			print("krunal")
			print("krunal","trivedi")====> krunal trivedi
			print("krunal","trivedi",35)=====>krunal trivedi 35




		Indexing == grab the character from the given index

		Slicing = grab the substring from the given string
				string[start:stop:jump] = =all  of these are optional
				it always include starting index
				it always take one less than stop index,

			mystring="Krunal Trivedi"

			print(mystring[0:8]) --- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7



  When you want to store collection of items , you need to implement Data Structures in Python


	(1) List:
			List is a mutable collection of items, items in the list can be added,updated,deleted programmatically
			Each item in the list is , seperated
			Each item in the list has an index, starting index is 0
			[]
			list()
			

		Primitve Types , Non-primitive Types


		size of the type is predefined				not predefined types

			int							object
			float							list, array,string
			decimal
		



	(2) Tuple:


		Tuple is an immutable collection of items -- cannot modify the items from the tuple
		as a read-only list
		each item in the tuple has an index, starting with 0
		each , item is considered as tuple in Python
		employess = "Ajeet,"Sona","Gaus"
		employess = ("Ajeet,"Sona","Gaus")
		()
		tuple()

			list1=["Apple","Orange"]
			mytuple=tuple(list1)
			

	"{} is {} years old".format(name,age)




	(3) Set:
		
		Set is mutable collection of unordered items -- items in set do not have index
		it would be in different order every time
		Set do not have duplicate items
		When existance of the item is important , not the order of the item -- we can go with Set

		Real time -- FB, Instagram,Twitter == #tainer #python 
			Web Page - meta tags -- SEO

		{}
		set()

	
	(4) Dictionary:

			Dictionary stores item in the key:value
			key must be unique
			it is mutable collection
			{"FirstName":"Krunal","Age":37}


		
	empty-list=[]
	empty-tuple=()
	empty_set=set()
	emopty_dict={}



	User Defined Functions:

	print()
	type()
	len()
	sorted()

	def Add(num1,num2):
		print(num1+num2)

	Add(10,20)
